#### Introduction
Xilinx's native bit-width conversion IP has efficiency issues in certain scenarios, such as when the AXI ARID is incremented with each access, which can be seen as the AXI access unable to be pipelined. Based on this, I have written a bit-width conversion module that supports cross-clock-domain operation, and it is currently only adapted for Xilinx devices.
xilinx原生提供的位宽转换ip在某些场景下存在效率低下的问题,比如axi的arid每次访问++,就可以看到axi访问无法pipline起来。基于此我写了一个位宽转换的模块,支持跨时钟域,目前只适配了xilinx器件。
## Features
support axi clock domain change and data wdith change
1. axi data width change support 1/2/4/8 times ,other case not support
2. axi data width only support 16/32/64/128/256/512/1024,other case not support
3. axi_arsize or axi_awsize must = DW/8,other case not support
4. axi_len must <=16 beats
